# Development Journal - Django NCP Project

## Session Summary - July 31, 2025

### Completed Tasks

#### üéØ **Primary Issue Resolution: IE Patient Search**
- **Problem Identified**: IE patient (Patrick Murphy) was not being found despite correct ISM configuration
- **Root Cause**: Bug in `LocalPatientSearchService.search_patient_summaries()` - PDF extraction method was receiving file path instead of XML content
- **Solution**: Fixed `patient_data/services/local_patient_search.py` line 75 to read XML content from file before passing to PDF extraction service
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Patrick Murphy (PPSN: 539305455995368085) now found successfully

#### üóÇÔ∏è **Test Data Directory Reorganization**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent directory structure with complex nested paths made search tools inefficient
- **Solution**: Created `reorganize_test_data.py` script that:
  - Extracts patient information from CDA documents
  - Creates clean, meaningful filenames (e.g., `Patrick_Murphy_53930545.xml`)
  - Organizes files by country code in flat directory structure
  - Creates backup of original structure
- **Results**: 24 XML files reorganized across 6 countries (IE, MT, LU, GR, EU, UNKNOWN)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### üß™ **Search Functionality Validation**
- **IE Search**: Patrick Murphy (539305455995368085) - ‚úÖ Working
- **MT Search**: Mario Borg (9999002M) - ‚úÖ Working (8 documents)
- **LU Search**: Multiple patients - ‚úÖ Working (10 documents, 2 unique patients)
- **All API Endpoints**: Ireland ISM configuration and validation - ‚úÖ Working

#### üîß **Technical Fixes Applied**
1. Fixed XML content reading in `local_patient_search.py`
2. Django server startup issue resolved (f-string formatting)
3. Test data structure optimized for search performance
4. Git commit with comprehensive changes

### Current Status
- **Django Server**: ‚úÖ Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- **IE Patient Search**: ‚úÖ Fully functional with PPSN validation
- **ISM API Endpoints**: ‚úÖ All working correctly
- **Test Data**: ‚úÖ Organized and searchable
- **Project State**: üü¢ **All critical functionality operational**

### Next Steps
1. Test enhanced patient search interface in browser
2. Verify CDA-to-FHIR conversion experimental feature
3. Additional country ISM configurations if needed

### Files Modified
- `patient_data/services/local_patient_search.py` - Fixed PDF extraction bug
- `reorganize_test_data.py` - New test data organization script  
- `test_data/eu_member_states/` - Complete directory reorganization
- Various configuration and styling files

### Key Learning
The issue was not with the ISM configuration or search logic, but with a data flow bug where the PDF extraction service expected XML content but received a file path. This demonstrates the importance of testing the full data pipeline, not just individual components.
