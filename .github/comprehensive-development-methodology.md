# Comprehensive Development Methodology - Django NCP

## Mission Statement

**"Dynamic, modular, reusable components that are never duplicated or programmed ad-hoc"**

This specification defines the complete development methodology for Django NCP, integrating **testing requirements**, **modular architecture**, **SCSS standards**, and **quality assurance** into a cohesive system that ensures professional-grade code with zero technical debt.

## Integration Architecture

### 🎯 Core Methodology Pillars

1. **Testing-First Development**
   - Every view/component has comprehensive unit tests
   - Integration testing for complete workflows
   - Security testing for all user interactions
   - Performance testing with defined benchmarks

2. **Modular Code Architecture**
   - Class-based views with mixin composition
   - Service layer for business logic
   - No view functions over 50 lines
   - Single responsibility principle

3. **Dynamic SCSS Components**
   - Context-aware styling systems
   - Zero CSS duplication
   - Healthcare colour palette integration
   - Mobile-first responsive design

4. **Quality Assurance Pipeline**
   - Automated testing before merge
   - Code review with mandatory checklist
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Security validation

## Workflow Integration

### 📋 Every Development Session Checklist

**Before Starting Any Code:**

- [ ] Review [Testing and Modular Code Standards](./testing-and-modular-code-standards.md) requirements
- [ ] Check [SCSS Quick Reference](./scss-quick-reference.md) for styling guidelines
- [ ] Plan modular architecture with reusable components
- [ ] Design test cases alongside feature planning

**During Development:**

- [ ] Write tests before implementation (TDD approach)
- [ ] Use class-based views with mixin patterns
- [ ] Extract business logic to service classes
- [ ] Follow SCSS component patterns for styling
- [ ] Keep view functions under 50 lines

**Before Committing:**

## Component Reusability Matrix

### 🧩 Backend Components

| Component Type | Reusability Pattern | Testing Requirement | Example |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **View Mixins** | Inherit in multiple views | Unit tests for each method | `PatientDataMixin`, `SessionValidationMixin` |
| **Service Classes** | Static/class methods | Comprehensive business logic tests | `PatientDataService`, `SessionManagementService` |
| **Utility Functions** | Import across modules | Edge case and error testing | `validate_patient_id()`, `format_cda_data()` |
| **Base Classes** | Template method pattern | Integration and inheritance tests | `BasePatientView`, `BaseCDAProcessor` |

### 🎨 Frontend Components

| Component Type | Reusability Pattern | SCSS Architecture | Testing Approach |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **UI Components** | Context-aware classes | `@include smart-icon-color()` | Visual regression testing |
| **Layout Mixins** | Foundation patterns | `@include card-foundation` | Responsive design testing |
| **Color Systems** | Variable-driven design | `$hco-primary-blue` variables | Accessibility testing |
| **Icon Systems** | Smart color adaptation | `@include perfect-icon-center` | Cross-browser validation |
