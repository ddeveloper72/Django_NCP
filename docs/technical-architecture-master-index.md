## Process Flow Reference

### Information Movement Patterns

The Django NCP system follows these key information flows:

1. **User Authentication & Session Management**
   - See: [Technical Architecture](./technical-architecture-and-information-flow.md#authentication-and-session-management)
   - Integration with CDA processing and patient data access

2. **Patient Data Processing Pipeline**
   - See: [Technical Architecture](./technical-architecture-and-information-flow.md#patient-data-processing)
   - Multi-stage processing with validation, transformation, and storage

3. **CDA Document Translation Workflow**
   - See: [CDA Processing](./consolidated-cda-processing-architecture.md#information-flow)
   - Medical terminology translation with quality assessment

4. **Styling and Frontend Architecture**
   - See: [CSS Architecture](./consolidated-css-scss-architecture.md#architectural-patterns)
   - Healthcare-compliant design system with component reusability

## Workload Management Integration

### Current System State

**Source**: [`.specs/retro-spec.md`](./.specs/retro-spec.md) - Current implementation status and compliance tracking

#### Implementation Compliance Status

- ‚úÖ **Git workflow with incremental commits**: Small, focused commits implemented
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced navigation accessibility**: WCAG-compliant navigation with ARIA labels
- ‚úÖ **Healthcare colour palette**: Implemented in navigation and design system
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Inline CSS removal**: Most templates cleaned, some blocks remain
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Template simplification**: Logic moved to Python, some cleanup needed
- ‚ùå **Mock data replacement**: Some views still contain hardcoded data
- ‚ùå **Unit test coverage**: Limited automated testing implemented

### Active Development Tracking

Use the `manage_todo_list` tool to track architecture consolidation progress:

#### Current TODO Status (Consolidation Project)

- ‚úÖ Analyze Existing Technical Architecture Documentation
- ‚úÖ Create Technical Architecture Flow Documentation
- ‚úÖ Consolidate CSS/SCSS Architecture Documentation
- ‚úÖ Consolidate CDA Processing Architecture
- üîÑ Create Unified Technical Architecture Index *(current task)*
- ‚è≥ Clean Up Duplicate and Outdated Documentation

### Decision Log Integration

Key architectural decisions documented in retro-spec:

| Component | Decision | Architectural Impact |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Template Engine** | Django templates over Jinja2 | Native security, simpler integration |
| **Styling System** | SCSS with healthcare compliance | Modular, maintainable CSS architecture |
| **Translation Services** | CTS-based over hardcoded | Medical credibility, no language hardcoding |
| **CDA Processing** | Multi-service architecture | Scalable, testable medical document processing |
