# Django NCP Development Session - August 2, 2025

## Overview

This session focused on:

1. Fixing URL configuration errors in the Django NCP patient details system
2. Developing a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) display tool with translation services
3. Creating bilingual display of medical documents (original language + English translation)

## Current Issue

- ImproperlyConfigured error: URLconf '19' does not appear to have any patterns
- Need to implement smart search for EU member state patient data
- Create translation service for CDA documents from various EU languages to English

## Key Files Modified

- Patient data views and URL configurations
- CDA document processing and display templates
- Translation service integration

## Next Steps

1. Fix URL configuration for patient details
2. Implement CDA translation service
3. Create bilingual display templates
4. Test with Luxembourg French CDA sample

## Technical Notes

- Using test data from: `C:\Users\Duncan\VS_Code_Projects\django_ncp\test_data\eu_member_states\`
- Sample CDA shows French medical data that needs English translation
- Need to preserve original medical terminology while providing English equivalents
