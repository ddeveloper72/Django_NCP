# CDA Processing Architecture

## Overview

This document consolidates all CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) processing components in the Django NCP system, providing a comprehensive guide to translation services, document processing pipelines, upload features, and terminology management. This architecture ensures proper handling of EU cross-border healthcare documents with medical credibility through Central Terminology Server (CTS) integration.

## Core Components

### 1. Enhanced CDA Processor

**Primary Service**: `patient_data/services/enhanced_cda_processor.py`

The Enhanced CDA Processor handles comprehensive clinical section processing with:

#### Key Capabilities

- CTS-compliant terminology service integration
- Country-specific CDA mapping (supports EU member states)
- Medical terminology translation through MVC model integration
- Clinical section extraction and processing
- Table rendering with PS Display Guidelines compliance

#### Service Architecture

```python
class EnhancedCDAProcessor:
    def __init__(self, target_language: str = "en", country_code: str = None):
        self.terminology_service = TerminologyTranslator(target_language)
        self.country_mapper = CountrySpecificCDAMapper()
        # Integration with Central Terminology Server models
        from translation_services.mvc_models import (
            ValueSetCatalogue, ValueSetConcept, ConceptTranslation
        )
```

#### Processing Workflow

1. **Document Analysis**: Extract clinical sections from CDA content
2. **Country Mapping**: Apply country-specific processing rules
3. **Terminology Translation**: Use CTS-based medical term translation
4. **Content Processing**: Generate structured clinical data with proper titles
5. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate translation completeness and accuracy

### 2. CDA Translation Services

#### Enhanced CDA Translation Service

**Location**: `patient_data/services/enhanced_cda_translation_service.py`

Provides comprehensive document translation with section-by-section analysis:

```python
@dataclass
class CDASection:
    section_id: str
    title: str
    original_title: str
    content: str
    original_content: str
    narrative_text: str
    original_narrative: str
    codes: List[Dict]
    translated_codes: List[Dict]
    translation_status: str
```

#### Translation Manager

**Location**: `patient_data/services/cda_translation_manager.py`

Orchestrates the complete translation pipeline:

- **Enhanced Processor Integration**: Uses EnhancedCDAProcessor for comprehensive clinical sections
- **XML Parser Integration**: Handles raw XML CDA content with medical coding
- **Quality Assessment**: Provides translation quality metrics and reporting
- **Multi-format Support**: Processes both XML and HTML CDA formats

### 3. Terminology Translation Architecture

#### Central Terminology Server Integration

The system eliminates hardcoded language translations in favor of medical credibility through CTS:

**Before (Hardcoded - DEPRECATED)**:

```python
class MedicalTerminologyTranslator:  # REMOVED
    def __init__(self):
        self.fr_to_en = {
            "Allergie": "Allergy",
            "Heure": "Time",  # Hardcoded French - violated no-hardcode requirement
        }
```

**After (CTS-Based - CURRENT)**:

```python
class TerminologyTranslator:
    def translate_clinical_document(self, document_content: str, source_language: str):
        # Extract terminology codes from document
        extracted_terms = self._extract_terminology_codes(document_content)
        # Translate using Central Terminology Server
        for term in extracted_terms:
            translation = self._translate_term(
                code=term["code"],
                system=term["system"],
                original_display=term.get("display")
            )
```

#### Compatibility Bridge

**Component**: `TerminologyTranslatorCompat`

- Maintains legacy method calls during architectural transition
- Provides smooth migration path from hardcoded to CTS-based translation
- Supports existing CDA translation workflows without disruption

### 4. Document Upload and Processing

#### Upload Feature Architecture

**Implementation**: Comprehensive CDA document upload system with:

- **Secure File Storage**: UUID-based filename generation in `media/uploads/cda_documents/`
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Modern UI with visual feedback states
- **Real-time Processing**: Integration with Enhanced CDA Processor
- **Session Management**: Document tracking and status monitoring

#### Upload Process Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant UI as Upload Interface
    participant S as Django Server
    participant P as CDA Processor
    participant DB as Database

    U->>UI: Select/Drop CDA File
    UI->>S: Upload Request (XML/CDA)
    S->>S: Validate File Type
    S->>S: Generate UUID Filename
    S->>P: Process with Enhanced CDA Processor
    P->>P: Extract Clinical Sections
    P->>P: Apply Terminology Translation
    P->>DB: Store Processed Document
    DB->>S: Return Document Index
    S->>UI: Processing Complete
    UI->>U: Display Results/Navigate
```

#### Document Management Interface

- **Status Tracking**: Processing status with visual indicators
- **Patient Information**: Extracted demographic and clinical data
- **Section Summaries**: Overview of clinical content with navigation
- **Batch Processing**: Support for multiple document handling

## Translation Quality Framework

### Quality Assessment Metrics

#### Translation Levels

- **Excellent (90%+)**: Comprehensive terminology coverage with clinical context preservation
- **Good (70-89%)**: Strong medical term translation with minor gaps
- **Fair (50-69%)**: Adequate coverage with some untranslated technical terms
- **Poor (<50%)**: Limited translation requiring manual review

#### Assessment Criteria

- **Section Translation Completeness**: Percentage of translated clinical sections
- **Terminology Translation Accuracy**: Medical code system coverage
- **Content Preservation**: Clinical context and meaning retention
- **Code System Coverage**: SNOMED CT, ICD-10, LOINC translation support

### Quality Indicators in UI

- **Color-coded Status Badges**: Visual quality representation
- **Section-level Scoring**: Individual clinical section assessment
- **Translation Summary Dashboard**: Overall document quality metrics
- **Terminology Tooltips**: Code system information and translation details

## User Interface Architecture

### Enhanced CDA Document Viewer

**Template**: `templates/jinja2/patient_data/enhanced_cda_document.html`

#### Viewing Modes

1. **Side-by-Side View**: Original and translated content simultaneously displayed
2. **Toggle View**: Switch between original and translated with section-level control
3. **Translated-Only View**: Clean interface with original accessible via tooltips

#### Interactive Features
