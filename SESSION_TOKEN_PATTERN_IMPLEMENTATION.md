# Session Token Pattern Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a session token pattern that separates web session management from patient identification. This resolves the confusion between session IDs and patient government IDs, enabling proper CDA data aggregation.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Session Token Architecture

- **Session ID (418650)**: Used for web application routing and session management
- **Patient Government ID (aGVhbHRoY2FyZUlkMTIz)**: Extracted from session data for CDA document lookup
- **Session Key Pattern**: `patient_match_{session_id}` stores the token containing patient data

### 2. Patient Government ID Extraction

```python
# Extract patient government ID from session token
patient_government_id = (
    match_data["patient_data"].get("primary_patient_id") or
    match_data["patient_data"].get("patient_id") or
    match_data["patient_data"].get("government_id")
)
```

### 3. CDA Content Aggregation by Government ID

- Searches ALL session data for matching patient government ID
- Aggregates CDA documents across multiple sessions for the same patient
- Uses most complete/recent CDA content available
- Ensures ALL contact information is displayed regardless of session

### 4. Enhanced Logging and Context

- Clear distinction between session ID and government ID in logs
- Context includes both IDs for proper routing and display
- Preserves session ID for URL navigation while using government ID for data lookup

## Benefits

### Security & Privacy

- Session tokens can have expiration times
- Government IDs are not exposed in URLs
- Proper separation of web session from healthcare identifiers

### Data Completeness

- Aggregates ALL CDA documents for a patient by government ID
- No longer limited to single session data
- Displays complete contact information from all available sources

### Architecture Clarity

- Clear separation of concerns
- Session ID for web routing, Government ID for healthcare data
- Eliminates terminology confusion

## Session Data Structure

```json
{
  "patient_match_418650": {
    "patient_data": {
      "given_name": "Mario",
      "family_name": "Borg",
      "primary_patient_id": "aGVhbHRoY2FyZUlkMTIz",  // Government ID (base64 encoded)
      "birth_date": "1980-05-15",
      "gender": "M"
    },
    "cda_content": "<!-- Full CDA XML -->",
    "l3_cda_content": "<!-- L3 CDA Content -->",
    "country_code": "MT",
    "confidence_score": 1.0
  }
}
```

## Testing Results

✅ Session token pattern working correctly
✅ Government ID extraction from session data
✅ CDA aggregation by government ID across sessions
✅ Complete data display in Extended Patient Information tabs

## Implementation Files Modified

- `patient_data/views.py`: Updated `patient_cda_view` function
- Added government ID extraction logic
- Implemented cross-session CDA aggregation
- Enhanced logging and context management

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and tested. The Extended Patient Information tabs will now display ALL available contact data for a patient based on their government ID, regardless of which session was used to access the data.

This resolves the core issue of only getting partial data and ensures comprehensive contact information display including:

- Complete addresses with formatted display
- All telecom information (phone, email, etc.)
- Demographics (DOB, Gender, Language)
- Related contacts (Author, Legal Authenticator, Custodian)
- Additional patient identifiers
