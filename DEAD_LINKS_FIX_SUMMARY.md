# Dead Links Fix Summary - Django NCP Healthcare Portal

## üéØ Objective
Fix all dead links in the navigation dropdown menus across the healthcare portal, ensuring proper integration with Django admin services and SMP monitoring functionality.

## ‚ùå Previously Dead Links Identified

### 1. SMP Monitoring Links (in Admin Dropdown)
- `/smp/logs/` - System Logs (404 Not Found)
- `/smp/performance/` - Performance Metrics (404 Not Found) 
- `/smp/audit/` - Audit Trail (404 Not Found)

### 2. Django Admin Links (in Admin Dropdown)
- `/admin/django_admin_log/logentry/` - Admin Activity Log (Incorrect URL)
- `/admin/contenttypes/` - Content Types (Incomplete URL)

## ‚úÖ Fixes Implemented

### SMP Monitoring Views & URLs Added
**File: `smp_client/views.py`**
- Added `system_logs()` view with access control and log display
- Added `performance_metrics()` view with SMP performance analytics
- Added `audit_trail()` view with comprehensive audit functionality

**File: `smp_client/urls.py`**
- Added URL pattern: `path("logs/", views.system_logs, name="system_logs")`
- Added URL pattern: `path("performance/", views.performance_metrics, name="performance_metrics")`
- Added URL pattern: `path("audit/", views.audit_trail, name="audit_trail")`

### Django Admin URLs Corrected
**File: `templates/base.html`**
- Fixed `/admin/django_admin_log/logentry/` ‚Üí `/admin/admin/logentry/`
- Fixed `/admin/contenttypes/` ‚Üí `/admin/contenttypes/contenttype/`

### Templates Created
**SMP Monitoring Templates:**
- `templates/smp_client/system_logs.html` - Professional system logs interface
- `templates/smp_client/performance_metrics.html` - Comprehensive metrics dashboard
- `templates/smp_client/audit_trail.html` - Multi-tab audit trail interface

## üîê Security Implementation

### Access Control
All new SMP monitoring views include proper authentication and authorization:
```python
@login_required
def system_logs(request):
    if not (request.user.is_staff or request.user.is_superuser):
        messages.error(request, "Access denied. Administrator privileges required.")
        return redirect('smp_client:dashboard')
```

### Admin Integration
- Views properly integrate with Django admin models
- Audit trail connects to Django's `LogEntry` system
- Performance metrics use actual SMP data models

## üìä Features Added
