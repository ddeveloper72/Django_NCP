##### 5. Django Configuration Updates (`eu_ncp_server/settings.py`)

- Middleware integration with proper ordering
- Session security configuration parameters
- Encryption settings and key management
- Cache configuration for session data
- Logging configuration for security events

### Security Architecture

#### Session Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Secure token generation with encryption key assignment
2. **Validation**: Middleware validates every request for protected paths
3. **Access Control**: Rate limiting and suspicious activity detection
4. **Rotation**: Automatic session ID rotation based on security triggers
5. **Expiration**: Automatic cleanup of expired sessions and cached data

#### Encryption Strategy

- **Master Key**: Environment-based master key for key derivation
- **Key Versioning**: Support for multiple encryption key versions
- **Automatic Rotation**: Time-based key rotation (configurable)
- **Data Protection**: All patient data encrypted at rest and in transit

#### Audit and Compliance

- **Comprehensive Logging**: All session activities logged for compliance
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and system health monitoring
- **Security Events**: Real-time detection and alerting for anomalies
- **Compliance Reports**: Automated reporting for HIPAA/GDPR requirements

### Configuration Parameters

#### Session Security Settings

```python
PATIENT_SESSION_TIMEOUT = 30  # minutes
PATIENT_SESSION_ROTATION_THRESHOLD = 100  # accesses
MAX_CONCURRENT_PATIENT_SESSIONS = 3
PATIENT_SESSION_RATE_LIMIT = 60  # requests per minute
```

#### Encryption Configuration

```python
SESSION_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM = "Fernet"
SESSION_KEY_ROTATION_HOURS = 24
PATIENT_SESSION_MASTER_KEY = "env_variable"
```

#### Monitoring Settings

```python
SESSION_CLEANUP_INTERVAL = 300  # seconds
SECURITY_ALERT_RECIPIENTS = ["security@organization.com"]
SESSION_MONITORING_ENABLED = True
```

### Database Schema

#### Core Tables Created

- `patient_sessions`: Main session storage with encryption metadata
- `patient_data_cache`: Encrypted cache for patient data
- `session_audit_logs`: Comprehensive audit trail

#### Key Indexes

- Session ID lookups for fast validation
- User and timestamp queries for analytics
- Expiration time for cleanup operations
- Security event queries for monitoring

### Integration Points

#### Protected Endpoints

- `/patients/cda/`: Patient clinical document access
- `/patients/details/`: Patient detail views
- `/patient_data/`: All patient data endpoints

#### Middleware Order

1. Django security and session middleware
2. PatientSessionMiddleware (session validation)
3. SessionSecurityMiddleware (security headers)
4. SessionCleanupMiddleware (cleanup operations)
5. AuditLoggingMiddleware (audit logging)

### Security Features

#### Industry Standards Compliance

- **HIPAA**: PHI protection with encryption and audit trails
- **GDPR**: Data protection and user consent management
